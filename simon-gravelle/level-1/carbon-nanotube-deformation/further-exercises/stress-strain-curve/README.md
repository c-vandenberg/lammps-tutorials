# Level 1 - Carbon Nanotube Deformation Further Exercises: Plot the Stress-Strain Curves

## Problem
In this exercise we will calculate stress-strain curve for both breakable bonds CNT and unbreakable bonds CNT.

## Solution
* The stress is calculated as the total force applied to the CNT from the deformation, divided by the surface area of the CNT
* We also need to include constants and conversion factors in our scripts, taking note of the difference in units between the OPLS-AA & AIREBO Force Fields
