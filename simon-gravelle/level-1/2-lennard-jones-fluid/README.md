## 2. Level 1 - Lennard-Jones Fluid: The Very Basics of LAMMPS

https://github.com/c-vandenberg/lammps-tutorials/assets/60201356/29bc8717-82b7-4de2-83be-f5acd5d3a72a

The objective of this tutorial is to perform the simulation of a binary fluid using LAMMPS.

The binary system is a Lennard-Jones Fluid composed of neutral particles with two different atomic radii in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions. The temperature of the system is maintained using Langevin thermostat, and basic thermodynamic properties of the system are outputted, such as pressure, and potential, kinetic & total energies.

The tutorial introduces some of the key features of a molecular dynamics simulation. This includes system initialisation for both the energy minimisation & molecular dynamics part of the simulation, integration of the equations of motion and trajectory visualisation using Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) molecular graphics software.
