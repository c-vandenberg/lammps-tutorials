# Evaluate The Deformation of The PEG Polymer Molecule

## Introduction
Once the PEG molecule is fully stretched, its structure differs from when it is not stretched. We can probe this deformation by extracting typical intra-molecular parameters such as dihedral angles.

In this exercise we will extract the histograms of the angular distribution of the PEG dihedral angles in before and after stretching.
