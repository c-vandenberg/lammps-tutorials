# Preparing The Water Reservoir

## Introduction

First, a rectangular water reservoir will be created & equilibrated in the absence of the PEG chain. The water model we will use is the Single Point Charge/Flexible Water (SPC/Fw) model is used <sup>1</sup>.

The SPC/Fw model is a refinement of the Extended SPC (SPC/E) model which is itself derived from
